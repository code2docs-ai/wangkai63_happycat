# Description

This is a Java class named User, which implements the Serializable interface for serialization. The class includes basic user information fields: uid (user ID), uname (username), upassword (password), sex (gender), uphone (phone), uimg (avatar), uprovince (province), ucity (city), ucountry (country), and udetail (detailed address). It provides getter and setter methods for all fields, as well as a constructor with all fields and a no-argument constructor. The class also overrides the toString method for outputting object information and defines serialVersionUID for version control.

```

This code defines a class named User that implements the Serializable interface, representing user information. The class includes basic attributes such as uid, uname, upassword, etc., along with corresponding getter and setter methods. Additionally, it provides two constructors (a no-argument constructor and a full-argument constructor) and a toString method. This class is primarily used for encapsulating and serializing user data, suitable for scenarios requiring user information persistence or transmission.

This code demonstrates a User class implementing the Serializable interface, containing 10 private fields and corresponding Getter/Setter methods. The class defines two constructors (full-parameter and no-argument) along with an overridden toString method. The flowchart clearly illustrates the class composition, including interface implementation, static constants, field attributes, constructors, and grouped method relationships. This design represents a typical data model class for storing user information with serialization support.
