| Language | .java |
| Code Path | happycat/gen/com/example/happucat/BuildConfig.java |
| Package Name | com.example.happucat |
| Dependencies | [] |
| Brief Description | The BuildConfig class contains a static DEBUG constant with a value of true, indicating the current debug mode. |

# Description

The content defines an immutable public class named BuildConfig, which contains a public static immutable Boolean variable DEBUG with its value set to true. This class is typically used for build configurations, where the DEBUG variable identifies whether the current mode is debug.

### UML Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BuildConfig {
        +final static boolean DEBUG
    }
```

This code defines an immutable final class `BuildConfig`, which contains a public, static, unmodifiable boolean constant `DEBUG` initialized to `true`. This class is typically used for build configurations, where the `DEBUG` flag determines whether the current mode is debug, enabling different logic handling between development and production environments. The `final` class and `static final` members ensure global uniqueness and thread safety.


### Internal Method Call Graph

```

This code defines a non-inheritable final class BuildConfig, which contains a public static final boolean constant DEBUG initialized to true. The constant is determined at compile time and cannot be modified, typically used to indicate whether the current mode is debug. The entire class structure is extremely simple, containing only a constant declaration without methods or other member variables. This design pattern is commonly used in automatically generated configuration files for Android projects.
